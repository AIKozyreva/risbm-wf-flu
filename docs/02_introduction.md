Influenza is a single-stranded RNA virus and contains a 13.5-14.5kb genome which is split into 8 segments encoding 10-14 proteins (dependent on strain).

The virus is classified using two proteins found on the outer surface of the viral capsid. Youâ€™ve probably heard of H1N1 Influenza for example. The H represents hemagglutinin and the N is neuraminidase.

This analysis workflow can be used with Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing data from amplified segments of the Influenza Type A and Type B genomes, to determine the most likely strain of Influenza to which the sequenced sample belongs.
